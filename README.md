# Medicare DBMS Project

## 📌 Description
This is a Database Management System (DBMS) project designed to model and manage core operations of a Medicare system using PostgreSQL. It focuses on creating and querying a well-structured relational database to support functionalities such as patient registration, doctor records, appointment scheduling, and billing. The project demonstrates database design principles including ER modeling, normalization, and efficient query writing, without involving any application-layer backend.

Developed as part of our academic curriculum, this project demonstrates practical use of SQL, ER modeling, and relational schema design.
